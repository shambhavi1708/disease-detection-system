# 🏥 Multi-Disease Prediction System

A web-based application that enables users to predict multiple diseases based on input symptoms and medical data. The system utilizes machine learning models to analyze user inputs and provide an estimated diagnosis.



## ✨ Features

✅ **Disease Selection** (Choose from multiple diseases for prediction)
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** (Simple form-based input via Streamlit)
✅ **Machine Learning-Based Prediction** (Utilizes trained models for accurate diagnosis)
✅ **Real-Time Analysis** (Instant results based on user inputs)
✅ **Secure & Private** (Data security ensured with local processing)



## ⚙️ Tech Stack

🔹 **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python-based UI Framework)  
🔹 **Backend:** Python (Flask for API, Pandas, NumPy)  
🔹 **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow  
🔹 **Database:** CSV / Local Storage  
🔹 **Deployment:** Localhost / Cloud (AWS, Heroku)
