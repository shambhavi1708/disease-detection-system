A Streamlit-based web application for predicting multiple diseases using machine learning models.
This web app allows users to input health parameters and get predictions for diseases such as Diabetes and Parkinson's Disease. It leverages machine learning models trained on publicly available datasets to provide accurate and quick predictions.

Features :
1. Diabetes Prediction
- Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on health metrics like glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and more.
- Provides clinical assessments for user inputs, highlighting potential health risks.

2. Parkinson's Disease Prediction
- Predicts the presence of Parkinson's Disease using voice measurement data.
- Displays detailed analysis of voice parameters and their significance.

3. Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
- Predicts the risk of cardiovascular diseases (e.g., heart attack, stroke) based on health metrics such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, and lifestyle factors.
- Provides a risk score and recommendations for improving heart health.

4. User-Friendly Interface
- Built with Streamlit, the app provides an intuitive and interactive interface for users to input data and view results.
- Features dynamic input fields with sliders, number inputs, and dropdowns for ease of use.

5. Model Accuracy
- Displays training and test accuracy scores for transparency.
- Ensures users understand the reliability of predictions.

6. Clinical Assessment
- Provides detailed clinical assessments for user inputs, highlighting potential health risks and actionable insights.

Technologies Used:
- Python: Core programming language.
- Streamlit: For building the web app interface.
- Scikit-learn: For training machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM).
- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
